# What is Citica?
Citica is an open-source project produced to inspire other creative minds to change the state of Minehut. Currently Minehut is overrun by hundreds of the same uncreative, unoriginal and low quality servers made purely for the profit of their creators.  
  
50% of the profits from Citica, after paying for the plan, will be donated to a charity chosen by the community every month.  
  
Another 25% of the profits will be donated to the server that follows the ideals of Citica best, as chosen by the community. 
  
# What will Citica end up as
> Citica will be a server where you attempt to create a city in the middle of a wasteland, while being constantly attacked by enemies.  
> You will start off with a single roundabout, or "point", and will build other points, which are connected with roads to each other. Off of each of these points, you will be able to build structures such as houses, farms, factories, windmills, etc.
> Farms, Factories and other structures ("Production Structures") will produce resources, given that you have allocated enough workers for them to run.  
> Houses and Cottages will allow you to create more workers.  
> Windmills and Power Plants will allow you to create more energy.
> Turrets and Lasers ("Weapon Structures") will allow for guards to shoot the enemies, otherwise they will just walk around uselessly.
> 
> There are 5 types of workers:
> 1. Builders. These workers will transport items from production structures and storage structures to places that you have chosen to build structures.
> 2. Transporters. These workers will transport items from one place to another. An example of when this would be used is transporting food to houses to create more workers.
> 3. Producers. These workers will simply produce items.
> 4. Guards. These workers will go into protective towers (ex: Turrets) and will shoot at nearby enemies.
> 5. Unassigned. These workers are completely useless and will do nothing.
  
# How can you help?
You can help change the status quo of Minehut by contributing to Citica, or by creating your own server that follows the ideals of Citica. As the creator of Citica, I will put my full support behind any (not-for-profit) recreation of Citica as well as any other innovative projects on Minehut, and hope that you will too.
