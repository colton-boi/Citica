# Citica Project
Citica is an open-source project produced to inspire other creative minds to change the state of Minehut. Currently Minehut is overrun by hundreds of the same uncreative, unoriginal and low quality servers made purely for the profit of their creators.  
  
50% of the profits from Citica, after paying for the plan, will be donated to a charity chosen by the community every month.  
  
Another 25% of the profits will be donated to the server that follows the ideals of Citica best, as chosen by the community.  

# How can you help?
You can help change the status quo of Minehut by contributing to Citica, or by creating your own server that follows the ideals of Citica. As the creator of Citica, I will put my full support behind any (not-for-profit) recreation of Citica as well as any other innovative projects on Minehut, and hope that you will too.
